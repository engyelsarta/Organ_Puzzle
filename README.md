# 3D-Anatomy-Puzzle
This project is a 3D anatomy puzzle game designed to help users learn about the human stomach by assembling its 3D parts. The game is interactive and engaging, combining elements of anatomy with puzzle-solving mechanics.

## Features

- **Drag and Drop Puzzle**
  - Six divided 3D parts of the stomach that users can drag and drop.
  - Parts snap together when they are within a threshold distance.

- **Rotational Controls**
  - Rotate the parts for better alignment during assembly.

- **Completion Check**
  - Assembled parts are validated, and the game confirms when the stomach is fully assembled.

- **Timer**
  - A built-in timer tracks the time taken to complete the puzzle.

- **Start Button**
  - Initial view shows the fully assembled stomach for reference.
  - After pressing the start button, the parts become visible, and the complete stomach is hidden.

## How to Play

1. Launch the game.
2. Press the **Start** button to begin.
3. Drag and drop the parts to reassemble the stomach.
4. Use rotational controls to align parts accurately.
5. Complete the puzzle to finish the game and view your time.

### Installation Steps:

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Build and run the game.

## Model Preparation  

The 3D sliced model of the stomach was created using Blender. The model was sliced into six parts for the puzzle game, allowing users to interactively reassemble them. This process was essential to ensure that the parts fit together correctly in Unity and provided a realistic and educational puzzle experience.

## Future Enhancements

- Adding more organs for a complete anatomy puzzle set.
- Implementing difficulty levels (e.g., smaller parts, time limits).
- Adding educational content about the stomach alongside the puzzle.
